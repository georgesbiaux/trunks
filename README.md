# Trunks
Trunks is an load testing tool destined to simulate the use of a web application by a important number of users. It is built on top of [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [serverless](https://serverless.com/), and is inspired by [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta).
